Last Updated: [Date]
Version: 1.0

1. Game Overview
Objective: Players compete to guess the percentage of survey respondents who answered a quirky or unexpected question (e.g., “What percentage of people have lied about their birthday?”). The closer the guess to the actual percentage, the more points earned. The player with the highest score after three rounds wins.

Target Audience: Casual gamers, families, trivia enthusiasts (ages 12+).
Platforms: PC, consoles (Switch, PlayStation, Xbox), mobile (iOS/Android).
Key Features:

Single-player and multiplayer modes (1–4 players, local/online).

500+ survey questions across categories (e.g., “Embarrassing Habits,” “Weird Food Combos”).

Dynamic percentage-guessing mechanics with a sliding scale.

Bonus “Risk Round” for high-stakes scoring.

Customizable avatars and unlockable themes.

2. Gameplay Mechanics
Core Loop:
Round Setup:

Each round presents a new survey question.

Players input their guess via a sliding percentage bar (0–100%).

Reveal Phase:

The correct percentage is unveiled on a large meter.

Points awarded based on proximity:

Bullseye (exact match): 100 pts.

±5%: 50 pts.

±10%: 25 pts.

±20%: 10 pts.

Beyond 20%: 0 pts.

Risk Round (Final Round):

Players wager their accumulated points on one final question.

Correct guess within ±10% doubles their wager; incorrect guess loses it.

Special Mechanics:
Power-Ups (earned via streaks):

Hint: Narrow the range (e.g., “The answer is between 30–60%”).
